# Instructions for Adding Background Music

## Quick Setup

1. **Find a music file**: You can use any MP3 file you have, or download royalty-free music from sites like:
   - Freesound.org
   - Incompetech.com
   - YouTube Audio Library
   - Pixabay Music

2. **Add the file**: Place your MP3 file in this `assets` directory and rename it to `background-music.mp3`

3. **Test**: Start the simulation with `npm start` and press [M] to toggle music

## Example File Structure
```
p5.js/
├── assets/
│   ├── background-music.mp3  ← Your music file goes here
│   └── README.md
├── src/
├── sketch.js
└── package.json
```

## Note
The code is already set up to load and play the music automatically. You just need to add the actual MP3 file!
