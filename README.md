# Blob Simulation - Generative Art Installation

## Project Overview

This is an interactive generative art piece featuring autonomous blob entities that form dynamic teams, engage in emergent behaviors, and create an ever-evolving visual ecosystem. The simulation explores themes of cooperation, competition, leadership, and collective behavior through algorithmic agents that make real-time decisions about alliances and conflicts.

## Creative Vision

### Artistic Concept
The blob simulation represents a digital ecosystem where simple entities exhibit complex emergent behaviors through local interactions. Each blob operates as an autonomous agent with unique characteristics (leadership, strength, aggression) that drive their decision-making processes. The visual outcome is a constantly changing landscape of colorful entities forming alliances, engaging in conflicts, and adapting to their environment.

### Generative Elements
- **Emergent Team Formation**: Individual blobs autonomously decide to cooperate or compete based on their intrinsic properties
- **Dynamic Color Harmonization**: Teams develop visual cohesion through synchronized color palettes
- **Procedural Combat System**: Strength-based interactions with random elements create unpredictable outcomes
- **Adaptive Leadership**: Teams dynamically select leaders based on leadership values, affecting movement patterns
- **Life Cycle Management**: Teams age, evolve, split through rebellion, and eventually dissolve, ensuring constant turnover

### Responsive Design Features
- **Conditional Formation Scaling**: Team formations adapt from linear arrangements (small teams) to circular patterns (medium teams) to double-circle structures (large teams)
- **Canvas-Responsive Movement**: Blob movement boundaries and wrapping behavior adjust automatically to any screen resolution
- **Population Density Management**: Simulation maintains optimal blob density regardless of canvas size, with configurable maximum limits

### Display Specifications
- Works seamlessly at any aspect ratio from mobile screens to large displays
- Responsive to screen resolution with automatic canvas sizing
- Optimized for digital-only output with no input required for core functionality
- Performance scaling based on available screen real estate

## Technical Implementation

### Core System Architecture
The simulation implements an object-oriented design with two primary classes:

- **Blob Class**: Individual entities with autonomous behavior, featuring:
  - Steering behaviors (seek, wander, separation, cohesion, formation)
  - Interaction system for cooperation/combat decisions  
  - Visual rendering with personal colors and status indicators
  
- **Team Class**: Collective entities managing group behavior:
  - Dynamic leadership selection based on blob attributes
  - Life/health system affecting team survival
  - Combat coordination and formation management
  - Rebellion and splitting mechanisms for large teams

### Generative Color System
Uses a high-contrast palette with intelligent color assignment:
- 20 predefined high-contrast colors for maximum visual distinction
- Team color harmonization when blobs form alliances
- Leader crown indicators with pulsing gold animations
- Combat glow effects and formation connection lines

### Emergent Behaviors
- **Cooperation Probability**: Inversely related to team aggression levels
- **Combat Outcomes**: Strength-based with random elements and team size modifiers
- **Team Rebellions**: High-aggression teams spontaneously split into factions
- **Life Cycle Events**: Random positive/negative events affect team health and behavior

## Installation & Usage

### Requirements
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Node.js and npm (for development server)
- No external dependencies - uses local p5.js library for offline capability

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd blob-simulation

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

The simulation will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Development Server Script
For automated setup with browser launching:
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x run-blob-dev.sh

# Run development environment
./run-blob-dev.sh
```

This script automatically:
- Installs Node.js if not present
- Installs npm dependencies
- Starts the server on port 8080
- Launches browser in kiosk mode for full-screen experience

### Configuration Options
Edit `config.json` to customize simulation parameters:

```json
{
    "initialBlobCount": 200,        // Starting number of blobs
    "maxBlobCount": 500,            // Maximum population limit
    "teamMaxSizeMin": 6,            // Minimum team capacity
    "teamMaxSizeMax": 14,           // Maximum team capacity
    "teamStartAggression": {        // Initial aggression range
        "min": 10, 
        "max": 50 
    },
    "combat": {                     // Combat damage parameters
        "baseDamage": 8, 
        "strengthDivisor": 8, 
        "randomDamageRange": 6 
    },
    "winnerLifeGain": 0.4,          // Life gained by combat winners
    "teamSizeProtection": 0.05,     // Protection from team size
    "largePenaltyThreshold": 6,     // Size threshold for penalties
    "largePenaltyRate": 0.15        // Extra damage for large teams
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Optimization Features
- **Collision Resolution**: Hard collision prevention with overlap detection
- **Interaction Cooldowns**: Prevents excessive computation from repeated interactions
- **Frame-Rate Based Updates**: Team dynamics update less frequently than visual rendering
- **Efficient Force Calculations**: Vectorized steering behaviors with magnitude limiting
- **Population Management**: Automatic blob generation/removal to maintain target population

### Scaling Behavior
- **Small Screens (mobile)**: Reduced population density with tighter formations
- **Large Displays**: Increased population with expanded movement boundaries
- **Performance Monitoring**: Configurable maximum blob limits prevent performance degradation

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Blob Overlap Prevention
**Solution**: Implemented dual-layer collision system with both steering-based separation forces and hard collision resolution that physically repositions overlapping entities.

### Challenge: Team Formation Stability
**Solution**: Created hierarchical force system where leaders navigate independently while followers use seek behavior toward leader positions with formation offsets.

### Challenge: Emergent Behavior Balance
**Solution**: Tuned interaction probabilities and combat outcomes through extensive parameter testing to achieve stable population dynamics without predictable outcomes.

### Challenge: Visual Clarity at Scale
**Solution**: Developed high-contrast color palette with team harmonization and selective rendering of UI elements based on screen space availability.

## Development Notes

### Technology Stack
- **p5.js 1.7.0**: Graphics rendering and animation framework
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: ES6+ features with class-based architecture  
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Hardware-accelerated rendering
- **Node.js HTTP Server**: Local development with live reloading

### Code Architecture Patterns
- **Entity-Component System**: Blobs and Teams as separate but interacting entities
- **Steering Behaviors**: Craig Reynolds flocking algorithms with custom formations
- **State Machine**: Combat/peaceful mode transitions with different behavior sets
- **Observer Pattern**: Global teams array updates when individual blob teams change

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

- **Genetic Algorithm Evolution**: Blobs could evolve characteristics over generations
- **Environmental Obstacles**: Static or dynamic barriers affecting movement patterns
- **Multi-Species Simulation**: Different blob types with unique interaction rules
- **Sound Integration**: Procedural audio generation based on simulation events
- **Data Visualization**: Real-time graphs of population dynamics and team statistics

## Reproducibility Guidelines

### For Third-Party Implementation
1. **Core Dependencies**: Only requires Node.js (v14+) and a modern web browser
2. **Configuration**: All behavioral parameters externalized to `config.json`
3. **Modular Design**: Blob and Team classes can be easily extended or modified
4. **Development Tools**: Included development script handles environment setup
5. **Cross-Platform**: Tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows environments

### Critical Implementation Details
- Blob collision resolution must run both before and after movement updates
- Team leadership selection should clear all previous leader flags before assignment
- Color harmonization requires global color palette initialization before blob creation
- Population management respects both minimum targets and maximum limits
